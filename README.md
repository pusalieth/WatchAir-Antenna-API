# WatchAir-Antenna
Reverse Engineer of the Watch Air Antenna to use with a PC, Kodi, and other useful software

This API is still in testing state, but is confirmed to work for most functions.
The intent of this API is to allow control, and setup of the WatchAir Antenna from a PC, with no need or usage of an app.


### Backstory
To bad this thing failed, as it's pretty great in theory.
The problem is it was made to do something most people will never use it for. I bought it on sale at Fry's for $25.
I saw it received Over the Air TV, and somehow streamed it over WiFi/internet. I looked online, but there are zero APIs to use it for a wireless TV antenna for Kodi, or stream it as a DLNA stream, both the normal use cases for IP TV tuners.
